# ProTrackR2: Manipulate and Play 'ProTracker' Modules

'ProTracker' is a popular music tracker to sequence music on a Commodore
Amiga machine. This package offers the opportunity to import, export,
manipulate and play 'ProTracker' module files. Even though the file
format could be considered archaic, it still remains popular to this
date. This package intends to contribute to this popularity and
therewith keeping the legacy of 'ProTracker' and the Commodore Amiga
alive. This package is the successor of 'ProTrackR' providing better
performance.
